# SME Customer Churn Prediction - BCG _**X**_

![BCG-X Report](visuals/Social_Media_Report_Presentation.png)


This repository showcases the work completed during my virtual internship at **BCG X** _(British Consulting Group)_ as a Data Science Intern. The project focuses on developing a machine learning solution to predict SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) customer churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Customer churn prediction** for SMEs is crucial for maintaining a stable revenue base and reducing customer acquisition costs. Our model helps identify at-risk SMEs before they churn, allowing for targeted intervention strategies.

### 📊 Key Results
- **91.1%** overall accuracy in churn prediction
- **61.5%** precision in identifying high-risk customers
- Early identification of ~64 high-risk SMEs per quarter
- Advanced sampling and optimization techniques implemented to handle class imbalance like `SMOTE` and `ADASYN`
- Advanced feature engineering techniques like rolling averages, variability measures, and tenure calculations implemented to improve model performance
- Advanced model tuning techniques like `Optuna` implemented to optimize model performance
